/**
 * What a run's events SAY, as text a person reads.
 *
 * A curated projection, never a dump: an event carries the machinery a run
 * happened on — hosts, paths, whole file bodies — and printing it would put
 * someone's filesystem in front of anyone who can read the run. Each kind gets a
 * sentence built from the few fields that describe the outcome; the rest is
 * dropped by omission, because a projection cannot leak a field it never reads.
 *
 * Every string here is rendered as TEXT by the transcript. Nothing is HTML.
 *
 * The coding plane's vocabulary (apps/coding): `status` for a lifecycle move
 * (started, routed, done, error, stopped, paused), `tool-call` for a step of the
 * run itself, `event` for one line of the agent's own structured narration (the
 * harness's JSON stream: its messages, reasoning, commands, edits, tool calls and
 * plan), and `log` for raw output, which only the Terminal's log shows. A
 * person's steering is a `control` {command, message}. A run on a project with a
 * site ends `done` with `live` when it published what it pushed, or `unpublished`
 * saying why it did not.
 *
 * `cards` is the transcript as it is drawn: the run's steps and the agent's
 * items, never its log.
