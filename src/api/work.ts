 * A project is a repository, so the list is those sources merged (merge.ts) and
 * not a second copy of them. An issue row from the board is read for what it
 * is: a forge issue names its forge repository and links to its page; a GitHub
 * issue the index mirrors names its address only in `extRef`
 * (`github:<owner>/<name>#<n>`), and its `number` there is the board's, not
 * GitHub's; any other index row's `repo` is what its writer said — a run's
 * repository, or a Linear team's key — and is resolved, never used raw.
 *
 * Creating, renaming and deleting a board are forge operations. This surface
 * reads the work and opens a run against it.
