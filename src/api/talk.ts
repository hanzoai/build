/**
 * Dev's conversation, as the platform keeps it (apps/agents talk.go): one
 * session, every turn.
 *
 *   POST /v1/agent/turns {session?, input, model?, effort?, repo?, base?, target?, mode?, issue?}
 *        → {sessionId, runId}
 *   POST /v1/agent/sessions/{id}/answer {question, text, chosen}   answer what a turn asked
 *
 * The first thing said opens the conversation; everything said after continues
 * the SAME session under a new run, once its last turn has answered — what is said
 * while a turn still works is that turn's next input (sessions.ts `message`). The
 * agent answers, and decides for itself when a turn needs a sandbox (leased on its
 * first use, kept for the conversation) or a coding run (which carries on the
 * conversation's last, in its sandbox and on its branch). A turn that only talks
 * uses neither, and a turn ends when its answer does: a build it started is
 * followed after, and its outcome is said into the conversation when it ends.
 *
 * The repository, branch, machine and mode are kept on the conversation from the
 * first message: every coding run its turns start works on them, auto starts it,
 * manual asks first (a question answered here), plan only reads and plans. The
 * model and effort ride each turn. Between turns the session rests `paused`.
