/**
 * A plugin: one thing the composer can do beyond words, picked from `+` ›
 * Plugins or by typing `@`. Chat and Dev offer the same list (`usePlugins`,
 * plugins/), each one running on Hanzo's own services.
 *
 * A plugin acts in one of two ways, or both:
 *
 *   open      picked, it shows something of its own (a sketch pad, a picker)
 *             and hands its result back to the composer: a file, the draft.
 *   prepare   while it is on in the conversation (Gear.plugins), it is asked
 *             just before each message goes, and what it answers rides that
 *             message: words for the leading system turn, files, or an answer
 *             of its own that replaces the model's (`reply`).
 *
 * A plugin whose service is not there for this person is not listed: `usePlugins`
 * answers only the ones that run.
