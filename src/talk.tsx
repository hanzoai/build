/**
 * A conversation in Dev (api/talk.ts): what the person said and what the agent
 * answered, at one address however many turns it takes — the way Chat reads.
 *
 * Every send continues the same session. While a turn works, what is said is that
 * turn's next input; once it has answered, the next turn. A build is never steered
 * from here — the words are the conversation's, and a build is steered from its
 * own page, which its card opens. The agent decides what a turn needs: an answer,
 * a sandbox (leased on first use and kept for the conversation), or a coding run,
 * whose outcome is said here when it ends. A question a turn asks — in Manual,
 * whether a build may start — is answered on its card. The line under the
 * transcript is what the turn is doing now, from its own progress. The mode pill
 * is the conversation's: Plan, Auto or Manual, kept from the turn it is sent with.
