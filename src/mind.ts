/**
 * Which model answers, and how hard it thinks: one store for Chat and Dev, and
 * the catalog both offer. The composer (@hanzo/ui/chat) changes it.
 *
 *   GET /v1/models   the catalog, read once per platform and shared
 *   hanzo.mind       the person's choice, in this browser: {model, effort}
 *
 * The effort is always under the composer; the model chip only where the person
 * turned it on (Settings → Appearance › Model in composer). Enso
 * routes every ask — a message in Chat, a step in Dev — so naming a model is an
 * override, and the panel says so before it offers one. A premium model is
 * picked for the screen it was picked on (`usePick`) and never kept, so the next
 * conversation or run opens on what was kept, Enso until something else is.
 *
 * The efforts are Auto, High and Max, Chat's words (Hanzo's
 * ThinkingEffort), Auto until another is chosen. A coding run takes low, medium
 * or high (apps/coding `efforts`), so `level` is what a run names: medium for
 * Auto, what a run took before anyone chose, and high for the rest, the most it
 * takes. Auto names one rather than none, because a run that names none takes
 * an effort the person saved to their account once (apps/coding start.go) and
 * no screen shows any more.
