 * Deep research: the Research switch, and the plugin row that flips it. One

 *
 * Before the message goes, a Hanzo model writes three to five web searches that
 * together cover it; each runs on the platform's live web search, the best
 * pages they found are read, and what was read rides the leading system turn
 * with the instruction to write a detailed report that cites it. Every call is
 * the person's own:
 *
 *   POST /v1/chat/completions   the plan (api/chat.ts)
 *   POST /v1/websearch          {q} → {results: [{url, title, content}]}
 *   POST /v1/crawl              {url} → {success, data: {markdown}}; a page it could not read is success:false
